/** 
 * The Memory chip implements the complete address space of the Hack data memory,
 * including RAM, memory mapped screen, and memory mapped keyboard.
 * Outputs the value of the memory location specified by the address input.
 * If (load == 1), sets the memory location specified by the address input
 * to the value of the in input.
 * Address space rules:
 * Only the upper 16K + 8K + 1 words of the memory are used.
 * Access to address 0 to 16383 (0x0000 to 0x3FFF) results in accessing the RAM;
 * Access to address 16384 to 24575 (0x4000 to 0x5FFF) results in accessing the Screen memory map;
 * Access to address 24576 (0x6000) results in accessing the Keyboard memory map.
