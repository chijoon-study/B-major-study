// Tests the Memory chip by inputting values to selected addresses, 
// verifying that these addresses were indeed written to, and verifying  
// that other addresses were not accessed by mistake. In particular, we 
// focus on probing the registers in addresses 'lower RAM', 'upper RAM',
// and 'Screen', which correspond to 0, %X2000, and %X4000 in Hexadecimal 
// (0, 8192 (8K), and 16385 (16K+1) in decimal).
